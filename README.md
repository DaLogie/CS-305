# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial institution that wants to implement additional security to their app.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Security is legally required at some level, especially for sensitive data like personal info or financial records. It starts with the first line of code and the architecture choices, but after that, it’s on everyone to follow best practices. Cyber attacks are all over and can be expensive for both users and app owners. Security isn’t a onetime thing every piece of code can have bugs and will eventually become outdated, so keeping it maintainable to keep it up to date is just as important.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
At the beginning I found it all to be hard. Keeping some things up to date was creating issues with the application that prevented it from running. I found it all the be helpful in the end when I finally dicovered how to do it.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Most vulnerabilities came from outdated libraries, so updating them makes the software more secure. In the future, penetration testing will help identify and fix even more potential weaknesses in the code.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After editing the code I would test it by running the code and testing the function on a web browser or by verifying no errors in the terminal. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used a ton of documentation for some of plugins specifically OSWAP and read a bit of threads on github. I ran into a ton of issues so I was able to find resoltion in those resources. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them that I was able to meet all the requirements and made great use of the tools I had.
